What is Jasmin?
===============

Jasmin is a very complete open source SMS Gateway with many enterprise-class features such as:

* SMPP Client / Server
* HTTP Client / Server
* Console-based configuration, no service restart required
* Based on AMQP broker for store&forward mechanisms and other queuing systems
* Using Redis for in-memory DLR tracking and billing
* Advanced message routing/filtering (Simple, Roundrobin, Failover, HLR lookup, Leastcost ...)
* Web and console ui for management
* Supports Unicode (UTF-8) for sending out multilingual SMS
* Supports easy creation and sending of specialized/binary SMS like mono Ringtones, WAP Push, Vcards
* Supports concatenated SMS strings (long SMS)
* Jasmin relies heavily on message queuing through message brokers (Using AMQP), it is designed for performance, high traffic loads and full in-memory execution.
